For one, the most of successful campaign (70%) have a goal to fundraise under 5000$. And 84% of all successful campaigns have less than 10000$ as a goal.
So, successful Kickstarter campaigns have smaller fundraising goals than failed Kickstarter campaigns.

In addition, goal amount from 45000$ and higher is as 88% failed Kickstarter campaigns.

With one more visualization of data it is clear that there is relation to amount of goal and amount of succesful campaigns.

# 3 CONCLUSION

So far, the analysis of Theater outcames by launch date
has shown that May seems to be a good month to launch a campaign.

Additionally, the observation of length of campaigns says that a bit shorter campaign more effective with the average around 27 days. But, generally, there is no big influence of length to succesful campaigns.

The summary of the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals displays that successful Kickstarter campaigns have smaller fundraising goals than failed Kickstarter campaigns as 84% all of successful campaigns with less than 5000$ goal.

To conclude, Louise is asking almost maximum of major successful Kickstarter goal, so this might be not great news for her campaign.

But, there is some data which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. It means, it needs to analyse the reasons of failed campaigns.

So far, the analysis is compiled some solid information to present to Louise to help inform her campaign strategy.
